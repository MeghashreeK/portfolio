            Hello, I'm Meghashree Kunder, a passionate Frontend Web Developer and a 2023 BSc Computer Science graduate. For me, creating websites isn't just a career choice; it's a true passion. 
            I love building websites that are not only functional but also well designed and fully responsive.
            Currently, I create websites using ReactJS, TailwindCSS, and Redux. The knowledge required for web development is like a vast ocean, and I am very much excited to dive deep and learn new technologies.
